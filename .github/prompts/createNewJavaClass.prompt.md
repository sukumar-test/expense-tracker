Create a Java class named `HttpClientFetcher` that implements an HTTP client to fetch data from a specified REST API endpoint. The class should include methods to configure the base URL, set request headers, and handle GET requests. Ensure proper error handling for HTTP responses and include comments explaining the code. Use Java's `HttpClient` API introduced in Java 11.
